1) print(json.dumps(dict(os.environ), index = 2)) returns all of the environment variables, print(os.environ) returns the same thing in a 
less pretty format

2) QUERY_STRING contains this information, which we can get out of the enviroment variables using os.environ['QUERY_STRING']

3) HTTP_USER_AGENT contains this information, and can be retrieved the same way as question 2

4) we use cgi.Fieldstorage() to store the given Fields then we can fetch each entry using getfirst("username") and getfirst("password")

5) we use Set-Cookie: username={username} and send this back to the client, we do the same for password

6) HTTP_COOKIE is our environment variable. the client sends back Cookie: username={username}; password={password} which we compare against our saved values,
if they match we skip the login screen

7) It allows us to store information and data for the user, for example in the login screen we can save the user's login information so that they don't have
to re-enter their credentials every time they refresh the page
